The Atmel ATmega32u4 gained popularity with its use in the Arduino
Leonardo, due to the built-in USB support, which made an additional
chip unnecessary for that purpose. Iâ€™ve had a couple of ATmega32u4s in
storage for a while, so I decided to try and solder the chip and make
an Arduino Leonardo compatible board out of it. Both Adafruit and
Sparkfun have ATmega32u4 breakout boards that they sell, and I
have used their designs as a reference. Why bother? Because if you are
developing an AVR based board with USB, this chip is worth looking at,
especially since you can use the existing Leonardo bootloader.
